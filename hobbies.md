<br>Outside of work, I find joy in hiking, exploring nature trails that offer both challenge and peace. Cooking is my creative outlet, where I experiment with flavors from around the world. Music keeps me inspired, and I love discovering new tunes. Traveling fuels my curiosity and broadens my perspectives.

## Volunteering

<br>I always remember the summer of 2018, I participated in an Overseas Volunteer Program in the city of Pokhara, Nepal. During this period, I collaborated with college students from various countries. My role was to serve as a math teacher and cultural communicator in a local primary school, where I taught students in grades two through four.<br>I have always been committed to participating in various volunteer activities, ranging from environmental protection to communication. I do my best to help people and use my own hands to make the world a better place.As my community waste sorting ambassador, I contributed to improving our environment in the neighborhood by organizing promotional events and practical on-duty tasks such as wiping trash bins and transporting garbage every week.  I also spent time visiting nursing homes, where I would spend time with the elderly, providing them with psychological support and performing entertainment programs for them. My cumulative volunteer hours exceeded 200.


## Connecting

I deeply value connecting with others, whether through networking or simply spending quality time with friends. Building meaningful relationships, sharing experiences, and learning from diverse perspectives enrich my life. I enjoy social gatherings, collaborating on ideas, and the fun of playing games together, which strengthens bonds and creates lasting memories.
